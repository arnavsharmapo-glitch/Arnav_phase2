# Challenge 1 : iq test

let your input x = 30478191278.

wrap your answer with nite{ } for the flag.

As an example, entering x = 34359738368 gives (y0, ..., y11), so the flag would be nite{010000000011}.

## Solution : 
- Opened the files i got in the challenge
- One was the description of the challenge which had our input as 30478191278
- Seeing the total number of logic gates on the other file and considering that they only take 0 or 1 as an inout, figured out that we would have to convert the input to a 36 bit binary input
- Got that number as 000001101100011000101001010101011110
- Now, I solved the logic gates and got the flag
![iq test Flag](../pics/iqtest.png?raw=true)

## Flag : 
```sh
nite{101100100101}
```

## Concepts Learnt :
