# Challenge 1 : buffer overflow 0

Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here.
Connect using:
nc saturn.picoctf.net 50348
- Hint 1 : How can you trigger the flag to print?
- Hint 2 : If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.
- Hint 3 : Run man gets and read the BUGS section. How many characters can the program really read?

## Solution : 
- Upon opening the instance, we get a C file for the source code
- Hint 2 in the instance suggested adding characters and the source code for the file mentioned the maximum size of buf2 as 16 characters
- So I used the key given in the instance to first connect with the challenge and upon being asked the input, just entered more than 16 characters
- This step gave me the flag
- Next i checked and found out that thus was due to a overflow error in buffer2
- The user input was strcpy(string copied) into buf2
- As we entered more than 16 characters, we got a segmentation fault, but this code was designed as to print out the flag and then leave rather than just terminating the programn on getting the error

## Flag : 
```sh
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_c5ca6248}
```

## Concepts Learnt :

- Learnt about overflow errors in C
- Learnt about the signal command

## Notes : 

Didn't understand what to do, so just tried entering more characters than specified in the code which funnily lead to the flag. Had to process what actually happened afterwards.

# Challenge 2 : format string 0

Can you use your knowledge of format strings to make the customers happy? </br>  
Download the binary here. </br>  
Download the source here. </br>  
Connect with the challenge instance here: </br>    
nc mimas.picoctf.net 64987

- Hint 1 : This is an introduction of format string vulnerabilities. Look up "format specifiers" if you have never seen them before.
- Hint 2 : Just try out the different options

## Solution : 
- Upon entering the instance, we get a binary, a source code and a key to connect to the challenge on any terminal
- On usng the key to connect to the challenge, we get the following situation
![format string 0](../pics/Screenshot%202025-10-29%20160633.png?raw=true)
- We see that there are 3 optionss available to us and are asked for the largest one
- Now, %114d is the largest one among the following options as it has a width of more than 114 characters
- After entering that as the recommendation, we get our second customer who agaon asks for the largest one
- Now we have to choose between %t and 3 %s', of which the latter is bigger so i entered it
- Now I got the flag and entered it
![format string 0 Flag](../pics/Screenshot%202025-10-29%20160728.png?raw=true)

## Flag : 
```sh
picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_f89c1405}
```

## Concepts Learnt :

- Learnt more about format specifiers

## Notes : 

No alternate tangents

# Challenge 3 : clutter over-flow

Clutter, clutter everywhere and not a byte to use.
nc mars.picoctf.net 31890

## Solution : 
- Open the challenge in ubuntu terminal
- From the source code, we got to know that there is a size variable defined for 0x100, i.e, 256 characters
- We also got to know that when we start overflowing that limit, thanks to the gets command used in the source code, we start getting values in the code variable in tha challenge
- We also know that we have to set the value of the code variable to 0xdeadbeef for it to match with the answer and give out the flag
- Just entering deadbeef after 264 characters didn't solve anuthing so i started for another forms to enter inputs
- After researching for a bit, I found out that many CTF's used little endian as their format to store data or enter inputs
- So i converted 0xdeadbeef into little endian form and then entered the same as the input
- When this also didn't seem to work, I had to settle for another method
- I used the echo command to enter the input and then pipe it into the challenge key, which then gave me the flag
![clutter overflow flag](../pics/Screenshot%202025-10-30%20184111.png?raw=true)

## Flag : 
```sh
picoCTF{c0ntr0ll3d_clutt3r_1n_my_buff3r}
```

## Concepts Learnt :

- Little endian and how to use it
- Learnt how to use echo on little endian to write a string
- Learnt about the -e argument for the echo command which is used to interpret for backlash escapes

## Notes : 

- Tried to overflow the input with normal characters but it didn't work
- Tried to enter 0xdeadbeef as binary at the end of the 264 characters which again, didn't work
