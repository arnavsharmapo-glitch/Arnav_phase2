# Challenge 1 : buffer overflow 0

Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here.
Connect using:
nc saturn.picoctf.net 50348
- Hint 1 : How can you trigger the flag to print?
- Hint 2 : If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.
- Hint 3 : Run man gets and read the BUGS section. How many characters can the program really read?

## Solution : 
- Upon opening the instance, we get a C file for the source code
- Hint 2 in the instance suggested adding characters and the source code for the file mentioned the maximum size of buf2 as 16 characters
- So I used the key given in the instance to first connect with the challenge and upon being asked the input, just entered more than 16 characters
- This step gave me the flag
- Next i checked and found out that thus was due to a overflow error in buffer2
- The user input was strcpy(string copied) into buf2
- As we entered more than 16 characters, we got a segmentation fault, but this code was designed as to print out the flag and then leave rather than just terminating the programn on getting the error

## Flag : 
```sh
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_c5ca6248}
```

## Concepts Learnt :

- Learnt about overflow errors in C
- Learnt about the signal command

## Notes : 

Didn't understand what to do, so just tried entering more characters than specified in the code which funnily lead to the flag. Had to process what actually happened afterwards.

# Challenge 2 : format string 0

Can you use your knowledge of format strings to make the customers happy? </br>  
Download the binary here. </br>  
Download the source here. </br>  
Connect with the challenge instance here: </br>    
nc mimas.picoctf.net 64987

- Hint 1 : This is an introduction of format string vulnerabilities. Look up "format specifiers" if you have never seen them before.
- Hint 2 : Just try out the different options

## Solution : 
- Upon entering the instance, we get a binary, a source code and a key to connect to the challenge on any terminal
- On usng the key to connect to the challenge, we get the following situation
![format string 0](../pics/Screenshot%202025-10-29%20160633.png?raw=true)
- We see that there are 3 optionss available to us and are asked for the largest one
- Now, %114d is the largest one among the following options as it has a width of more than 114 characters
- After entering that as the recommendation, we get our second customer who agaon asks for the largest one
- Now we have to choose between %t and 3 %s', of which the latter is bigger so i entered it
- Now I got the flag and entered it

## Flag : 
```sh
picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_f89c1405}
```

## Concepts Learnt :

- Learnt more about format specifiers

## Notes : 

No alternate tangents
