- You also have to enter the passcode as mentioned in the plan file
- Paste the flag
![tftp analyser](../pics/Screenshot%202025-10-27%20230743.png?raw=true)

## Flag : 
```sh
picoCTF{h1dd3n_1n_pLa1n_51GHT_18375919}
```

## Concepts Learnt :

- Learnt about steganography and how to use some sites for that online
- Learnt how to analyse network traffic using applications such as WireShark

## Notes : 

Didn't understand what to do at all at first. Then had to look up how to open that kind of file and proceeded with how to export the informatuion from that file onto the windows system. Was able to solve the challenge after that
