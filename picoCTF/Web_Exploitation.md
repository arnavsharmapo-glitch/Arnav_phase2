## Flag : 
picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_94190c8a}

## Concepts learnt : 
- I learnt how to access cookies and how to change their values. 
- Also learnt that we have to always refresh the web page after changing the values in the cookies section tyo get the required changes.

None


# Challenge 2 : SSTI 1

I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!
I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!
```sh
http://rescued-float.picoctf.net:64075/announce
```

## Solution : 
- Open the instance
- Go to the mentioned website
- Check whether the website follows a Jinja2 engine or not
- Read the file to check if the flag is there or not
- Make the commands executable to check for more information where you get to know that there is a flag file there in the directory
- Read that file as it contains the flag
- Copy and paste the flag

## Flag : 
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_9451989d}

## Concepts learnt : 
- I learnt what a Jinja2 engine is
- Also learnt how to read files and how to execute commands on that file.

### Notes :
Tried to see if anything were to happn if I used inspect elemnt on the website, turns out nothing much.
The hint mentioned about Server Side Template Injection so I read up on that a little bit and did the challenge.
