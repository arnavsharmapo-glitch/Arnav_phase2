# Challenge 1 : Cookies

Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. 
```sh
http://mercury.picoctf.net:21485/
```

## Solution : 
- Open the instance
- Go to the mentioned website
- Inspect the website and go the the cookies section and change the values there until you get your flag
- Copy and paste the flag you got

## Flag : 
picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_94190c8a}

## Concepts learnt : 
- I learnt how to access cookies and how to change their values. 
- Also learnt that we have to always refresh the web page after changing the values in the cookies section tyo get the required changes.

### Notes :
Accidentally started researching cookies names to enter because i didn't know that we had to change values in the cookies section instead

### Reference : 
None


# Challenge 2 : SSTI 1

I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!
I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!
```sh
http://rescued-float.picoctf.net:64075/announce
```

## Solution : 
- Open the instance
- Go to the mentioned website
- Check whether the website follows a Jinja2 engine or not
- Read the file to check if the flag is there or not
- Make the commands executable to check for more information where you get to know that there is a flag file there in the directory
- Read that file as it contains the flag
- Copy and paste the flag

## Flag : 
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_9451989d}

## Concepts learnt : 
- I learnt what a Jinja2 engine is
- Also learnt how to read files and how to execute commands on that file.

### Notes :
Tried to see if anything were to happn if I used inspect elemnt on the website, turns out nothing much.
The hint mentioned about Server Side Template Injection so I read up on that a little bit and did the challenge.

# Challenge 3 : Web Gauntlet

Can you beat the filters?
Log in as admin http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:54545/ 
http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:54545/filter.php

- Hint 1 : You are not allowed to login with valid credentials.
- Hint 2 : Write down the injections you use in case you lose your progress.
- Hint 3 : For some filters it may be hard to see the characters, always (always) look at the raw hex in the response.
- Hint 4 : sqlite
- Hint 5 : If your cookie keeps getting reset, try using a private browser window

## Solution : 

- Open both the links provided to you
- In one link, you will find a pop-up asking for a username and a password and the other link shows us what are the omitted words/commands/functions/operators for that particular round
- We are required to login as admins in each of the challenges
- The first one bans the use of {or} in the input
- I looked up for common filters in sqlite and how to bypass them and found the same line-up there, which allowed me to learn that we had to enter our username as admin and then stop the site from taking or readinf=g any more input from us
- This made me use admin’-- as the username as -- stops the site from accepting any more input after the AND, so we can use any random string in the password section to move forward
- Now, in the second round, we were banned from using {or and like =  --}, which means that we can't use our username from the first round
- Researching further, I found out that we could use /* to fill the same conditions as -- in the previous round
- So, I entered admin’/* as the username for the second round and used a random string as the password
- In the third round, we were denied the use of {or and = like > < --} in our inputs
- Since we were not using any of that in our earlier inputs, the same input that I used for the second round worked here as well with the password as a random string again
- But now in round 4, we were banned the usage of {or and = like > < -- admin}, which as we can see includes the word admin itself
- Upon researching for ways to enter a string in different parts but for it to combine them again before processing, I found out a format called concatenation which allowed us to enter the input without explicitly using the word admin
- I then entered the input of the 4th round as admi'||'n'/* and the password as a random string and was allowed to go to the 5th round
- The 5th round agin banned the use of {or and = like > < -- union admin}, but since the username we used for the 4th round didn't contain any of the banned characters, I just used the same input agin as a random string for password
- Upon entering that, I was allowed permission into the 6th round which gave me a prompt to check out the file filter.php
- On seeing the file, I was able to get the flag as it was printed at the bottom of the file
